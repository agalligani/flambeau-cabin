              <h3>Skunk Frank Poem</h3>
              <p>
                The Flambeau twist and turns we say,
                <br />
                Through forest lands along its way.
                <br />
                Its ripples produce a brilliant spray.
                <br /> This squatter camped along the shore, A fellow filled
                with logging lore For many years has kept the score, Of all who
                floated by his door. The scenic wonders at his stand, Would make
                you, exclaim ain’t it grand? Yet how he loved to shake your
                hand, This Hermit of the Flambeau Land Frank lost a leg, yet on
                a wooden peg, He could put all other guides to shade And never
                did you walk or wade, For he could POLE just any grade The
                beverage found behind Frank’s door, Would make you sleep hours
                twenty-four And make you dream as well as snore, Of Musky, Pike,
                and Flambeau Lore. His camping place on that Flambeau shore, At
                Beaver Dam, that folks all did adore Has lost some of that
                friendly score, For Hermit Frank is there no more. This
                character, this well-known guide, With a big heart, and a black
                bear hide Could ride the Rapids at high tied, To watch him made
                you thrill inside The memory of “SKUNK FRANK” folks now
                accklaim, For to Beaver Dam Rapids he added fame Yet the thrills
                and spills are not the same, Without the Flambeau Hermit—Skunk
                Frank the name
              </p>
